        <h2>Rules~</h2>

        <p>
            Everyone knows the rules of tic-tac-toe, but in case you didn't,
            here is a handy excerpt from wikipedia:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth
            English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game
            for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a
            three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing
            three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is
            the winner." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe"
                >https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe</a
            >)
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            A couple of other important bits and pieces, however are that
            <em>player one</em> is "X" and always starts, so subsequently
            <em>player two</em> goes second and places "O"s. We have decided to
            adopt Premier League-esque rules for scoring, however, so if you win
            you get three points, if you lose you get zero, and if you draw you
            both get one point. Best of 300 games officially is the cooler
            person so this game can (and has) been used to settle major
            international disputes. We hope you enjoy.
